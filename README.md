# ZipForge
A modular and performant set of file compression algorithms.
Currently only supports huffman encoding.

# Getting Started: 
To get started follow the following instructions: 
```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
./MyProject
```

To use the functions, add `core-algorithms.hpp` to your include $PATH and the compression algorithms you wish to use to your project in the src directory
